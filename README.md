# Erupt

### A slick dark code editor and sytax theme for [Jet Brains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) ide's such as [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/). 

This theme has very much been inspired by the popular [predawn](https://github.com/jamiewilson/predawn) theme for Sublime Text.

# Compatibility

Please note I have only tested this theme with Webstorm 2016.1.1, I beleive it should work with other Jet Brains IDE's such as PHP Storm but your millage may vary. Please put in a pull request if you modify to work others.
